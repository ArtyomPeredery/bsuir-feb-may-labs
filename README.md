## Lab 04
# News App

## Task description
# Create a client-side application that shows the latest news using NewsAPI
## Use cases
# Show a list of top news (5 at first) and a button ‘Load more’
# Decide for yourself what you’d like to show on the news card
# When clicking on the news card or button ‘Read more’ (choose one) you should be redirected to the original source of the article
# After clicking on the ‘Load more’ button another 5 news should be shown
# Continue showing news by clicking on the ‘Load more’ till there are 40 news on the page or less (if there are less than 40 news at all)
# There should be an ability to filter news by sources. When user selects a source, only news from this source should be shown on the page
# There should be an ability to search news by query. When user enters query in the search input and presses the button ‘Search’ or clicks # Enter (both should work), only news regarding this query should be shown on the page 
# Show ‘There are no articles matching your request’ if there are no articles matching your request
